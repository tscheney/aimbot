Disclaimer:

The code in here was written in the last few weeks of the semester. as such,
we decided to be as quick as possible and not use classes, since we wanted
everyone's help and not everyone knew Python.

I would advise that you use classes. The code in here is sometimes
scary, and I have a hard time remembering what was what.

But hey, we won. So maybe there's something to be said for it.

"""
Notes of things I have changed that may need to be changed back:
    (April 7th)
    - Constants.py:     distance_behind_ball_for_kick = robot_half_width so the approach is better. With kicker, approach can be smaller
    -                   kickable_distance = 0.4 from 0.5
    -                   kick_dist --> SHOULD I make this smaller, so the error after kick is less?                   

    - Utilities.py      robot_close_to_point() Changed tolerances from 0.10 to 0.07 


    Changed these to use BALL FUTURE POSITIONS:
    - Skills.py:        go_behind_ball_facing_target()
                        attack_ball()
                        attack_ball_towards_goal()

    - Plays.py          line 66
                        steal_ball_from_opponent() # lines 201-203 were using future positions of the ball 

    - Utilities.py      get_perpendicular_point_from_ball()
                        get_own_goal_dist_behind_ball()



Things I'm currently/need to work on:
    - Using future positions of ball for attack/shooting
    - Collision avoidance with our own robots. Fix am_i_too_close_to_teammate to have robot future positions.
