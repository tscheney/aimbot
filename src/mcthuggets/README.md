McThuggets - Robot Soccer example package
=========================================

This example package is a slimmed down version of the [original code](https://github.com/zamora18/robot-soccer) of the 2016 BYU Robot Soccer champtions, the Chicken McThuggets.

It was simplified so that the ROS architecture could be easier to understand and so it would work for the new Gazebo Robot Soccer simulation competition. Much of the complex functionality has been removed.
