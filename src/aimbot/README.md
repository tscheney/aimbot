Team Parker - Another demo team
===============================

This is another demo team for the [robot soccer simulator](https://github.com/embeddedprogrammer/soccersim). Others include:

- [demoteam](https://github.com/plusk01/soccersim-aimbot)
- [mcthuggets](https://github.com/plusk01/soccersim-mcthuggets)

**Note:** ROS/catkin does not like hyphens (`-`) in your file path. Rename this repo as simply `aimbot`:

```bash
$ mv soccersim-aimbot aimbot
```
