# notes on waypoint path finding from http://rwbclasses.groups.et.byu.net/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=robot_soccer:material:waypoints.pdf
#   1.) He suggests having a few functions, one that will clear the waypoint
#       stack, another that will push a new waypoint onto the stack, another
#       that will remove one (pop) from the stack, and a debugging one that
#       lets us see what points are on the stack.
#
#   2.) For now im not doing object avoidance, ill try to make it so that
#       it can get behind the ball and push towards the goal, from there
#       we can add in the abilty to avoid the objects in our way as we
#       go to score
#   Effectivly this would be a smarter version of rush goal, it will try to
#   get behind the ball then push to the goal.
